# Java Library Backend Application

This is a simple Java-based backend application for managing books and authors in a library system. It is built using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf, and it provides a web interface for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books and authors.

## Features

- **Manage Books**: Add, edit, and delete books.
- **Manage Authors**: Add and list authors.
- **Book Details**: Each book is linked to an author, and users can update the book details including its title, genre, publication year, and author.
- **Responsive Interface**: The application uses Tailwind CSS for a responsive and clean user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: A framework used for building the backend of the application.
- **Thymeleaf**: A Java-based template engine for rendering HTML views.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database interaction.
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for simplicity (can be replaced with any other database like MySQL).
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the frontend.
